# Natural-Scenes-Classification

__image__

This project classifies an image into various scenes(Buildings, Forest, Glacier, Mountain, Sea, Street). Tensor Flow API is used for solving the problem. 

Transfer Learning was applied with InceptionV3 model. Pretrained weights were used for these layers. 
Some final layers of the pretrained model were not used, and a few layers were added at the end to help network train on custom dataset.


Following are some of the predictions made by the model.
